# ESP8266 Heart Rate Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a heart rate sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller. It reads and displays the analog output from the heart rate sensor on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Heart Rate Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Heart Rate Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **Analog Output (Signal) Pin:** Connect to an analog pin on ESP8266 (e.g., A0).
   - **VCC:** Connect to 3.3V or 5V pin on ESP8266.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND pin on ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view the analog readings from the heart rate sensor.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, ensure the heart rate sensor is properly placed and connected.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor to see the analog values representing the heart rate sensor output.

#### Applications
- **Health Monitoring:** Use for monitoring heart rate in wearable devices or health monitoring systems.
- **Fitness Tracking:** Integrate into fitness devices for real-time heart rate monitoring during workouts.
- **Biometric Systems:** Incorporate into biometric systems for user authentication based on heart rate variability.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Placement:** Ensure proper placement of the heart rate sensor on the body for accurate readings.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure stable power supply to the ESP8266 and the heart rate sensor for reliable operation.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate the sensor if necessary to match the expected range of heart rate values.
